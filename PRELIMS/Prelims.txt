**Dito natin lagay mga notes natin :)**

Internet	- global network of networks(google)
- hierarcy, infrasturcture
INTER NETWORKING
inter - outside
intra - within the border
Network	- interconnected devices ('nodes')
        		- share data
Interconnected technologies – Wired /Wireless.
Protocols –rules to interact to each other.
Store and Forward (S &F)-  send message without establishing connection.
characterized by
1.Hardware
	a. nodes - the actual devices i.e computers 
		   IoT - Internet of Things
	b.Interconnected Technologies - Wired - utp, fiber; Wireless - infrared,bluetooth
2.software
	a.protocols
	b.device drivers -software that run active (something missing here)

computer to computer  - serial communication
	             		- one cable, send data with 1s and 0s
Problems of wired and wireless - susceptible to noise
LAN - Local Area Network
interconnection of networks with the use of ISPs
different ISPs can connect with each other
connection between countries - underwater(preferred)/ satellite

1969 - modern internet was  born
circuit switch network -- used by old telephones
store and forward - cellphones (texting)

IPv4 - 32-bit
IPv6 - 64-bit

Early 1960's --> DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) --> packet switch
		circuit switch - relaying and keeping the connection
		packet switching
	 	send and forward --> send-->store-->send-->...until it reaches the destination
	
ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency NETwork) --> 4 computers communicate
First popular app --> email - 1972

World Wide Web 	- information system that uses Hypertext links
	       		- information system on the internet
	    	 	- allows documents to be connected to other documents  by hyperlinks
- was created for researchers and scientist to share their findings and research
	       		- back then it is more textual

Wide Area Information Service (WAIS)  - multiple server locations
				    	 - early information service

Gopher (protocol) - application layer protocol
		     - similar to WAIS
		     - hierarchical in nature
		     - distibuting, seraching, retrieving
		     - a TCP/IP application layer protocol designed for distributing searches and retrieving documents over the internet

USETNET - worldwide distributed discussion system
	   - similar to discussion groups
Semantic Web – analyzes the meaning of the searches.

1989 (Sir Tim Berners-Lee) --> HTTP, HTML, URL

HTML – HyperText Markup Languge
URL – Uniform Resource Locator
HTTP FUNDAMENTALS
HTTP - jointly developed by the 23c and the IETF
	- standard way of communicating
ITCF – Internet Engineering Task Force
	Version history
	HTTP 0.9 (1991)
	HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1945, edited may 1996)
	HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068 Rewritten specifications on Jan 1997)
	HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015)
o	Patterned by SPDY
o	Backwards compatible with HTTP 1.1
	-HTTP runs on top of TCP/IP, port 80 by default. Port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS)
-Socket is the combination of IP address and a port 
-Port numbers range from 0-1024
	-IANA
	-HTTP is based on client-server architecture
•	Clients AKA user agents
-web browsers, web crawlers/spiders (google bot), other end user tools
•	Servers
-engine servers, proxy servers, gateways, tunnels
	-HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol
•	The client sends an HTTP request message to the server
•	The server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message
•	Pull push poll
-HTTP is a stateless communications protocol
•	Servers do not keep info about clients in between requests
-HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as 
•	Cache control
•	Content media type (MIME – multipurpose internet mail extension) specification
•	Language and character specification
•	Context/transfer codings
•	Content negotiation
•	Client server protocol negotiations
•	Persistent connection
•	Request pipelining
•	Authentication/autorization
	web Server
Web Client  
Semantic web - next step
	            - uses natural language
HTTP RESOURCE ADDRESSING
Http resources are identified doing URI’s (RFC 3986) or more specifically HTTP URIs
•	Scheme (http/https)
•	Authority
o	User information or authentication credentials (deprecated).
•	host
•	domain  name (resolved to an IP address using DNS) of the server where the resource resides (or will be created).
•	Port number
•	Path – path to resource (resolved relative to the document root on the server)
o	May refer to a static/dynamic resource
•	Query
o	Typically provided as key value pair with (&) separators between key/value pairs
o	May be URL – encoded.
•	Fragment identifier (bookmark) - #
HTTP REQUEST MESSAGE
•	Request Line
o	Method
o	Request URI
o	HTTP Protocol Version
•	Message Headers (general, request, and/or entity headers)
o	HTTP 1.1 requres at least the host request header to be provided
•	Empty line (CRLF)
•	Message Body

HTTP RESPONSE MESSAGE

•	Status Line
o	HTTP Protocol Version
o	Status Code 
o	Reason Phrase
•	Message Headers (general, request, and/or entity headers)
•	Empty Line
•	Message Body
Status Code:
	Informational (1xx) – 100(Continue), 101(Switching protocol)
	Success (2xx) -
	Redirection (3xx) -304(Not modified)
	Client Error (4xx)- 400(Bad Request), 401(Client Error)
	Server Error (5xx)
HTTP REQUEST METHODS 
•	Put
o	Store the enclosed entity in the message body under the specified request URI
•	Delete
o	Delete a data in a server
•	Options
o	To know what the option request type that is allowed to the client
•	Trace
o	Request a loopback of the request (request the server to echo back to the client the received request message)
•	Connect
o	Request the establishment of a tunnel
•	Safe methods
o	Not affecting any data
•	Idempoted methods
o	Repeatedf execution, same result
•	Cacheable methods

HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
-  by Tim Burners Lee
- is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
- takes document using markup.
- Structure & Content (Main focus)
-Presentational / aesthetic (old format)
Website- is a collection of web resources such as wen pages and web applications.
	- it is being host.
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) – Tim Burners Lee
-	Is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the web.
Not already recommended codes in HTML:
•	Character entities:
o	&nbsp –tab
o	&lt – less than
o	&gt – greater than
•	<br>
•	Tables –for tabular presentation.

HTML versions:
Current – 5.1
HTML 1.0 – 1989
	2.0 – Nov 1995 RFC18661L
	3.0 – superseded by 3.2
	4.0 – December, 1997
	4.1 – 1999

Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)
Version: 1.0 – January 26, 2000
		Revised August 1, 2002
-	It is used for data interchange
-	Wrappers up structure of a document
Ian Hidson – proposed to go back to HTML
- WHATWG 
	- later becomes HTML5 that is standardized in 2014

HTML 4.0
•	Transitional – depreciated
•	Strict
•	Frameset

The Internet
	Internet is global network of networks, means it is a global network that millions or billions of computers are connecting to each other to exchange data, information and many more. Internet is decentralized or it’s independent, because each computer or host that is linked to the network is independently working as its own. It operates specific local services that will be available globally and others may connect to it. 
	There are many theories and claims about the origin of the internet. One of the theories said that the very first packet switching exchange was on October 29, 1969 of the ARPANET which led by professor Leonard Kleinrock. It was said that there are 4 computers that were linked together in different places. The Second theory was creation of the TCP/IP which is a backbone protocol that was developed by Vinton Cerf and other members of a networking group in 1970’s in California. It was developed to solve problems of ARPANET on the linking of computers. This theory states that the beginning of the internet was the meeting and development of the TCP and the discussion of the problems about the interconnecting multiple packet networks. The third theory was originated to the origins of Telco. Kim Veltman said that the very first digital transmission and switching was made by the AT&T Bell Labs in 1962 (nethistory.info, 2004). There are many more claims of theories on the origin of the Internet and it is still on examination.
