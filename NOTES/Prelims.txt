**Dito natin lagay mga notes natin :)**

Internet	- global network of networks(google)
- hierarcy, infrasturcture
INTER NETWORKING
inter - outside
intra - within the border
Network	- interconnected devices ('nodes')
        		- share data
characterized by
1.Hardware
	a. nodes - the actual devices i.e computers 
		   IoT - Internet of Things
	b.Interconnected Technologies - Wired - utp, fiber; Wireless - infrared,bluetooth
2.software
	a.protocols
	b.device drivers -software that run active (something missing here)

computer to computer  - serial communication
	             		- one cable, send data with 1s and 0s
Problems of wired and wireless - susceptible to noise
LAN - Local Area Network
interconnection of networks with the use of ISPs
different ISPs can connect with each other
connection between countries - underwater(preferred)/ satellite

1969 - modern internet was  born
circuit switch network -- used by old telephones
store and forward - cellphones (texting)

IPv4 - 32-bit
IPv6 - 64-bit

Early 1960's --> DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) --> packet switch
		circuit switch - relaying and keeping the connection
		packet switching
	 	send and forward --> send-->store-->send-->...until it reaches the destination
	
ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency NETwork) --> 4 computers communicate
First popular app --> email - 1972

World Wide Web 	- information system that uses Hypertext links
	       		- information system on the internet
	    	 	- allows documents to be connected to other documents  by hyperlinks
- was created for researchers and scientist to share their findings and research
	       		- back then it is more textual

Wide Area Information Service (WAIS)  - multiple server locations
				    	 - early information service

Gopher (protocol) - application layer protocol
		     - similar to WAIS
		     - hierarchical in nature
		     - distibuting, seraching, retrieving

USETNET - worldwide distributed discussion system
	   - similar to discussion groups

1989 (Sir Tim Bernerns-Lee) --> HTTP, HTML, URL

HTML - 
URL –
HTTP FUNDAMENTALS
HTTP - jointly developed by the 23c and the IETF
	- standard way of communicating
	Version history
	HTTP 0.9 (1991)
	HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1945, edited may 1996)
	HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068 Rewritten specifications on Jan 1997)
	HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015)
o	Patterned by SPDY
o	Backwards compatible with HTTP 1.1
	-HTTP runs on top of TCP/IP, port 80 by default. Port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS)
-Socket is the combination of IP address and a port 
-Port numbers range from 0-1024
	-IANA
	-HTTP is based on client-server architecture
•	Clients AKA user agents
-web browsers, web crawlers/spiders (google bot), other end user tools
•	Servers
-engine servers, proxy servers, gateways, tunnels
	-HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol
•	The client sends an HTTP request message to the server
•	The server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message
•	Pull push poll
-HTTP is a stateless communications protocol
•	Servers do not keep info about clients in between requests
-HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as 
•	Cache control
•	Content media type (MIME – multipurpose internet mail extension) specification
•	Language and character specification
•	Context/transfer codings
•	Content negotiation
	web Server
Web Client  
Semantic web - next step
	            - uses natural language
