**Dito natin lagay mga notes natin :)**

Internet	- global network of networks(google)
- hierarcy, infrasturcture
INTER NETWORKING
inter - outside
intra - within the border
Network	- interconnected devices ('nodes')
        		- share data
Interconnected technologies – Wired /Wireless.
Protocols –rules to interact to each other.
Store and Forward (S &F)-  send message without establishing connection.
characterized by
1.Hardware
	a. nodes - the actual devices i.e computers 
		   IoT - Internet of Things
	b.Interconnected Technologies - Wired - utp, fiber; Wireless - infrared,bluetooth
2.software
	a.protocols
	b.device drivers -software that run active (something missing here)

computer to computer  - serial communication
	             		- one cable, send data with 1s and 0s
Problems of wired and wireless - susceptible to noise
LAN - Local Area Network
interconnection of networks with the use of ISPs
different ISPs can connect with each other
connection between countries - underwater(preferred)/ satellite

1969 - modern internet was  born
circuit switch network -- used by old telephones
store and forward - cellphones (texting)

IPv4 - 32-bit
IPv6 - 64-bit

Early 1960's --> DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) --> packet switch
		circuit switch - relaying and keeping the connection
		packet switching
	 	send and forward --> send-->store-->send-->...until it reaches the destination
	
ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency NETwork) --> 4 computers communicate
First popular app --> email - 1972

World Wide Web 	- information system that uses Hypertext links
	       		- information system on the internet
	    	 	- allows documents to be connected to other documents  by hyperlinks
- was created for researchers and scientist to share their findings and research
	       		- back then it is more textual

Wide Area Information Service (WAIS)  - multiple server locations
				    	 - early information service

Gopher (protocol) - application layer protocol
		     - similar to WAIS
		     - hierarchical in nature
		     - distibuting, seraching, retrieving
		     - a TCP/IP application layer protocol designed for distributing searches and retrieving documents over the internet

USETNET - worldwide distributed discussion system
	   - similar to discussion groups
Semantic Web – analyzes the meaning of the searches.

1989 (Sir Tim Berners-Lee) --> HTTP, HTML, URL

HTML – HyperText Markup Languge
URL – Uniform Resource Locator
HTTP FUNDAMENTALS
HTTP - jointly developed by the 23c and the IETF
	- standard way of communicating
ITCF – Internet Engineering Task Force
	Version history
	HTTP 0.9 (1991)
	HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1945, edited may 1996)
	HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068 Rewritten specifications on Jan 1997)
	HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015)
o	Patterned by SPDY
o	Backwards compatible with HTTP 1.1
	-HTTP runs on top of TCP/IP, port 80 by default. Port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS)
-Socket is the combination of IP address and a port 
-Port numbers range from 0-1024
	-IANA
	-HTTP is based on client-server architecture
•	Clients AKA user agents
-web browsers, web crawlers/spiders (google bot), other end user tools
•	Servers
-engine servers, proxy servers, gateways, tunnels
	-HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol
•	The client sends an HTTP request message to the server
•	The server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message
•	Pull push poll
-HTTP is a stateless communications protocol
•	Servers do not keep info about clients in between requests
-HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as 
•	Cache control
•	Content media type (MIME – multipurpose internet mail extension) specification
•	Language and character specification
•	Context/transfer codings
•	Content negotiation
•	Client server protocol negotiations
•	Persistent connection
•	Request pipelining
•	Authentication/autorization
	web Server
Web Client  
Semantic web - next step
	            - uses natural language
HTTP RESOURCE ADDRESSING
Http resources are identified doing URI’s (RFC 3986) or more specifically HTTP URIs
•	Scheme (http/https)
•	Authority
o	User information or authentication credentials (deprecated).
•	host
•	domain  name (resolved to an IP address using DNS) of the server where the resource resides (or will be created).
•	Port number
•	Path – path to resource (resolved relative to the document root on the server)
o	May refer to a static/dynamic resource
•	Query
o	Typically provided as key value pair with (&) separators between key/value pairs
o	May be URL – encoded.
•	Fragment identifier (bookmark) - #
HTTP REQUEST MESSAGE
•	Request time
o	Method
o	Request URI
o	HTTP Protocol Version
•	Message Headers (general, request, and/or entity headers)
o	HTTP 1.1 requres at least the host request header to be provided
•	Empty line (CRLF)
•	Message Body

HTTP RESPONSE MESSAGE

•	Status Line
o	HTTP Protocol Version
o	Status Code 
o	Reason Phrase
•	Message Headers (general, request, and/or entity headers)
•	Empty Line
•	Message Body
Status Code:
	Informational (1xx) – 100(Continue), 101(Switching protocol)
	Success (2xx) -
	Redirection (3xx) -304(Not modified)
	Client Error (4xx)- 400(Bad Request), 401(Client Error)
	Server Error (5xx)
HTTP REQUEST METHODS 
•	Put
o	Store the enclosed entity in the message body under the specified request URI
•	Delete
o	Delete a data in a server
•	Options
o	To know what the option request type that is allowed to the client
•	Trace
o	Request a loopback of the request (request the server to echo back to the client the received request message)
•	Connect
o	Request the establishment of a tunnel
•	Safe methods
o	Not affecting any data
•	Idempoted methods
o	Repeatedf execution, same result
•	Cacheable methods
•	Extension Methods
o	WEBDAV RFC 4918
o	Propfind, proppicthc,mkcol,copy,move,lock,unlock.

HTTP Message Headers
	Response Header Fields
	Used by servers
	Response messages 
•	Accept Ranges
•	Age
•	Etag
•	Location
o	used for redirection
•	Proxy Authenticate
•	Retry-after
•	Server
•	Vary

•	Allow
•	Content Encoding
•	Content Language

HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
-  by Tim Burners Lee
- is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
- takes document using markup.
- Structure & Content (Main focus)
-Presentational / aesthetic (old format)
Website- is a collection of web resources such as wen pages and web applications.
	- it is being host.
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) – Tim Burners Lee
-	Is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the web.
Not already recommended codes in HTML:
•	Character entities:
o	&nbsp –tab
o	&lt – less than
o	&gt – greater than
•	<br>
•	Tables –for tabular presentation.

HTML versions:
Current – 5.1
HTML 1.0 – 1989
	2.0 – Nov 1995 RFC18661L
	3.0 – superseded by 3.2
	4.0 – December, 1997
	4.1 – 1999

Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)
Version: 1.0 – January 26, 2000
		Revised August 1, 2002
-	It is used for data interchange
-	Wrappers up structure of a document
Ian Hidson – proposed to go back to HTML
- WHATWG 
	- later becomes HTML5 that is standardized in 2014

HTML 4.0
•	Transitional – depreciated
•	Strict
•	Frameset
