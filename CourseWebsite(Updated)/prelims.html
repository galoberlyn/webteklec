                </h3>
                <p>
                	Internet is global network of networks, means it is a global network that millions or billions of computers are connecting to each other to exchange data, information and many more. Internet is decentralized or it’s independent, because each computer or host that is linked to the network is independently working as its own. It operates specific local services that will be available globally and others may connect to it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many theories and claims about the origin of the internet. One of the theories said that the very first packet switching exchange was on October 29, 1969 of the ARPANET which led by professor Leonard Kleinrock. It was said that there are 4 computers that were linked together in different places. The Second theory was creation of the TCP/IP which is a backbone protocol that was developed by Vinton Cerf and other members of a networking group in 1970’s in California. It was developed to solve problems of ARPANET on the linking of computers. This theory states that the beginning of the internet was the meeting and development of the TCP and the discussion of the problems about the interconnecting multiple packet networks. The third theory was originated to the origins of Telco. Kim Veltman said that the very first digital transmission and switching was made by the AT&T Bell Labs in 1962 (nethistory.info, 2004). There are many more claims of theories on the origin of the Internet and it is still on examination.

                <p>
                The World Wide Web is a global information medium on the internet that allows documents to be connected to the other documents by linking hyperlinks and identified using Uniform Resource Locator. Hypertext was influenced by the Memex of Vannevar Bush, Markup Language of IBM and the Project Xanadu of Ted Nelson. The World Wide Web uses protocols; Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The Web is unidirectional which making someone link to another sources without action by the source. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Tim Berners Lee was working in CERN with the project named ‘Enrique.’ It was him who created the WWW on 1989 in Switzerland. Availability of web server software and browser on 1991. CERN declared on April 30, 1993 that the web is free to everyone. World Wide Web Consortium was founded by Tim Berners Lee to administer the improvement of the web. Another mentionable man, Robert Cailliau makes a great impact on the creation of the web. It was very popular for billions people and access it for fact-finding. Many search engines such as Yahoo and Google takes in action, as well as commercial sites like Amazon. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many misunderstood and mistakenly think that the Internet and the World Wide Web are the same. Internet is a larger scale which is a global system of network of networks while the Web is just a part of the internet and one of the global information medium that is a global collection of documents that uses hyperlinks, URL and HTTP.

            <h4 class="sub-sub-topic">HTTP</h4>
            <p>
                It is an application layer protocol that allows user of the World Wide Web to share information found in web pages. Its standard port connection is port 80 and  and for HTTPS its port 443.
            </p>
            <h4 class="sub-sub-topic">Overview</h4>
            <p>
            The standards development of HTTP was coordinated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for Comments (RFCs) RFC 2616 (June 1999) defined in HTTP/1.1, the version of HTTP most commonly used today. In June 2014, RFC 2616 was retired and HTTP/1.1 was redefined by new RFCs 7230-7235. HTTP/2 is currently in draft form.    
            </p>
            <h4 class="sub-sub-topic">VERSION HISTORY</h4>
            <P>
                <ul>
                <li>HTTP/0.9 was the first version of the HTTP, and was introduced in 1991.</li>
                <li>HTTP/1.0 is specified in RFC 1945, and was introduced in 1996.</li>
                <li>HTTP/1.1 is specified in RFC 2616, and was officially released in January 1997</li>
                <li>HTTP 2.0 - became an approved standard in 2015. It maintains backward compatibility with HTTP 1.1 but offers additional performance enhancements.</li>

                <p>
                The client sends a request to the server then the server generates a response for each request of the client.

            <h5 class="name">Resource Identification</h5>    
                <p>
                    Every http request includes a URI.

                <p>
                    In a session the server doesn’t store any information of the client.
