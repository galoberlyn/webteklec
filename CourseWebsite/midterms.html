            Brief Description
            </h3>
            <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language written in a markup language, is used for formatting Web pages layout. While HTML is for the structure and content of a Web pages, CSS is a language used to specify the presentation aspects of web pages. It is used to design HTML; define text styles, layout display, format table sizes and other formatting aspects for HTML.</p>

            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>CSS like HTML, W3C standardized CSS and make it open for all and released in 1996. It was first proposed and developed by Hakon Wium Lie (CHSS) on October 10, 1994 and Bert Bos (SSP) who become the co-author of CSS. But it was not a new idea that time, Tim Berners-Lee on 1990 wrote his NeXT browser/editor specify a simple style sheet.<p>

            <h4>VERSIONS</h4>

            <h5>CSS 1</h5>
            <p>Hakon Wium Lie and Bert Bos developed the first CSS and was standardized and recommended officially by W3C. It is the CSS level 1 and it was published December 17, 1996. It is capable of: formatting font properties; Changing of color of some elements such as text and backgrounds; Layout of text, tables, and images; Capable of making and editing paddings, border, margin and positioning of elements. It can also specify foreground and background color, as well as background images. </p>
            
            <h5>CSS 2</h5>
            <p> Developed by W3C, CSS level 2 was published and recommended by W3C on May 1998. It added some capabilities like making boxes that behaves like tables, availability of powerful selectors, specification of positioning of elements, availability of media types, style rules, added some font properties and bidirectional text. It was revised and called CSS 2.1, due to the fixing of errors and removes poorly supported features. CSS 2.1 become a Candidate Recommendation first on February 25, 2004 and was developed further more until it was become a W3C recommendation on June 7, 2011.</p>

            <h5>CSS 3</h5>
            <p>CSS3 was divided into what they called ‘modules,’ meaning it was separated into several documents. Each module can be a recommendation by different people, but some specifications are implemented by any browsers. Some module have new capabilities, some have extended features. Drafts of CSS 3 was released June of 1999. 50 CSS 3 modules was released as of June 2012, but only four of these are considered formal recommendations such as: Media Queries, Namespaces, Selectors Level 3 and Color.</p>

            <h5>CSS 4</h5>
            <p>It doesn’t have a single CSS 4 specification, and there is no standard name CSS 4, but it is divided into modules, and it does have level 4 modules. These level 4 modules are preceding the functionalities of level 3 modules, like the modules Selectors, Image Values and Background & Borders. </p>
            

            <h4>HTML/XHTML STYLESHEETS</h4>

            <h5>AUTHOR STYLES</h5>
            <p>Author is the one who made the codes of the CSS and embeds it to use it for websites. Author styles is the CSS file that is linked into the HTML. It is the default CSS style that the author of the code made.</p>

            <ul><h5 class="name">External Style Sheet</h5>
            <p>External CSS files that is in .css format contains stylesheet rules that will be included together with your HTML document that will be linked using the 'link' tag.</p></ul>

            <ul><h5 class="name">Internal Style Sheet</h5>
            <p>It is the CSS stylesheet rules that is embedded inside of your HTML document. It is located inside of the header section by the 'style' tag.</p></ul>

            <ul><h5 class="name"> Inline Style Sheet </h5>
            <p>Using the style attribute, you can define the style rules that will be apply directly into your specific HTML elements. It is good to use for making a particular style for one element, because it overrides the rules of an External CSS rules.  </p></ul>

            <h5>USER STYLE</h5>
            <p>The users or the site’s visitors are the one who is viewing your website. User style allows the users to optionally override the style of the author, by defining their own stylesheets. They can set rules about font sizes, system colors and others to satisfy their own preferences. </p>

            <h5>USER AGENT STYLES</h5>
            <p>Browser applications such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are examples of the User Agent. We use these browsers to view websites. User agents has its own default stylesheet, but you can inspect the properties of the website that you are viewing.    </p>
